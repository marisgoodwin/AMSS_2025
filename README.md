Title: Understanding seasonality of fish biodiversity using eDNA metabarcoding in Kachemak
Bay, Alaska
Authors: Maris R. Goodwin, Zack Gold, Jennifer L. Tusten, Jessica R. Glass
As global climate change rapidly impacts Arctic and subarctic marine ecosystems,
scientists need tools that will rigorously quantify changes in biological communities. Arctic
biodiversity monitoring is essential as glacial estuaries face recession, where the dynamic
convergence of freshwater and marine environments has historically supported diverse
ecological communities. Genomic sequencing tools such as environmental DNA (eDNA)
metabarcoding complement conventional fisheries approaches (e.g., netting) by providing in-
depth, rapid, and non-invasive assessments of species composition. We implemented eDNA
metabarcoding to assess its utility as an ecological monitoring tool in 5 estuarine sites in
Kachemak Bay, Alaska with varying degrees of glacial coverage (0 â€“ 60%). We analyzed
(n=100) eDNA samples from April and September 2022 in Kachemak Bay to tease apart
seasonal and spatial patterns in fish diversity and to assess the extent to which environmental
variables drive community composition. Results suggest a stronger influence of seasonal drivers
on fish biodiversity than spatial drivers. Detections of fish taxa were higher using eDNA than
conventional beach seining. The results of this study will build on existing baseline data to
document changes in a region heavily impacted by climate change.
